### Notes ###

To run Skin Composer on OSX, use the executable Mac release. If that fails, download the skin_composer_mac.jar version of the app and run it via terminal with the following command: **java -XstartOnFirstThread -jar skin_composer_mac.jar**

To run/build the project in Idea/Android Studio, do the following:

* In 'File/Project Structure...' set the project language level to 10
* Update run configuration with the following VM Option: -XstartOnFirstThread
